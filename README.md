As a developer transitioning into the tech industry from another field, this website serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills, experiences, and projects. Designed with Next.js and styled using SASS with Motion Framer for smooth transitions, it represents the culmination of my journey into software development.

## Description

This Next.js application is a personal project designed to display information about myself, my journey into development, and the projects I've worked on. It integrates technologies like React, SASS, and Motion Framer for transitions, with additional features such as Calendly for scheduling and a MongoDB Atlas connection for storing data.
